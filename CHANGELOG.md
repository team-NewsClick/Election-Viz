# Changelog

We use for versioning.
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). It diverges in the following ways:

- Release titles do not link to the commits within the release
- This project only strictly adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for bug fix releases.
